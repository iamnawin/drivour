```
🚗✨ Building Drivour - an open-source route discovery app

Google Maps shows the fastest route.
We show the most INTERESTING route.

Think: trending cafes, hidden gems, Instagrammable spots — all along your drive.

MVP in progress. Contributors welcome! 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 - Problem:**
```
The problem: Weekend drives are boring point-to-point trips.

The solution: Turn every route into a curated experience.

Example: Banjara Hills → Gachibowli isn't just "30 mins"
It's 8-10 interesting stops worth exploring.
```

**Tweet 3 - Tech Stack:**
```
Built with:
- React Native (Expo)
- Google Maps API
- n8n for scraping trending spots
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS for spatial queries

100% open source

**Title:**
"Building Drivour - Open source route discovery app (Contributors welcome!)"

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/reactnative! 👋

I'm building **Drivour** - an open-source mobile app that transforms boring navigation into a discovery experience.

## The Idea
Instead of just showing the fastest route (like Google Maps), we show trending spots, hidden gems, food places, and Instagrammable locations along your drive.

Example: Your weekend drive becomes a curated experience with 8-10 interesting stops.

## Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- React Navigation
- React Native Maps
- Node.js backend (coming soon)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- n8n for scraping

## Current Status
MVP in development. Basic route input screen done, working on Google Maps integration next.

## Why Open Source?
I want to build this with the community! Different cities, different vibes - community knowledge will make this 10x better than I could alone.

## How to Contribute
- Frontend development
- Design/UX improvements
- Backend API
- Scraping workflows
- Documentation

Check out the repo: [GitHub link]

First-time contributors very welcome! Tagged some issues as `good first issue`.

Would love feedback, collaborators, or just a star! 🙏

## What I'm Building

Drivour - a route discovery app for turning boring drives into adventures.

**Problem:** Google Maps = fastest route. But what about the most INTERESTING route?

**Solution:** Show trending cafes, hidden gems, food spots, shopping, all along your drive - categorized and curated.

## Use Case Example
Planning: Banjara Hills → Gachibowli (Hyderabad)

Instead of just "30 min drive":
- 🍽️ That biryani place everyone's posting about
- ☕ Hidden cafe perfect for a break
- 📸 Instagrammable spot on the way
- 🛍️ Local market worth a detour

## Tech Stack
React Native, Google Maps API, PostgreSQL, n8n scraping

## Why I'm Sharing
Building in public! Open sourcing from day 1. Need contributors for:
- Frontend (screens, components)
- Backend (API, trending algorithms)
- Design/UX
- Data/scraping

## Current Progress
- ✅ Project setup
- ✅ Route input screen
- ⏳ Maps integration (next)
- ⏳ Discovery screen
- ⏳ Trending algorithm

**Looking for:** Co-builders, feedback, design help, or just moral support! 😄

"Built my first React Native app - Open source route discovery (Feedback welcome!)"

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey everyone!

I just started building my first serious React Native project and decided to open source it from the beginning.

## Project: Drivour
A route discovery app that shows interesting stops along your drive (cafes, food, hidden gems, etc.)

## What I've Learned So Far
- React Navigation setup
- Expo workflow
- Component structure
- State management basics

## What I'm Struggling With
- Google Maps integration (next on my list)
- Best practices for file structure
- Managing complex state (Zustand? Redux?)

## Why I'm Sharing
1. Accountability (building in public)
2. Learn from experienced devs
3. Help others learning React Native
4. Maybe find collaborators!

**Code quality feedback super appreciated** - I'm still learning!

GitHub: [link]

Is my component structure okay? Any beginner mistakes I should fix now?

"Building Drivour: An Open Source Route Discovery App (Day 1)"

**Tags:**

# Introduction

Today I'm starting a journey to build **Drivour** - an open-source mobile app that makes every drive an adventure.

## The Problem
We've all been there: You need to drive across town. Google Maps gives you the fastest route. You arrive. Mission accomplished.

But what if the journey could be as interesting as the destination?

## The Solution
Drivour shows you trending spots, hidden gems, and interesting places along your route:
- 🍽 Food & restaurants
- ☕ Cafes & chill spots  
- 📸 Instagrammable locations
- 🛍 Shopping & local markets

All categorized, all worth a detour.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React Native (Expo) - for rapid mobile development
- React Navigation - screen routing
- React Native Maps - obvious reasons 😄

**Backend (Coming Soon):**
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS - spatial queries
- Redis - caching trending data
- n8n - scraping automation

## Day 1 Progress
- ✅ Project setup with Expo
- ✅ Basic navigation structure
- ✅ Route input screen
- ✅ README & contributing guides
- ⏳ Google Maps integration (tomorrow)

## Why Open Source?

I believe the best version of this app comes from community contribution. Different cities have different vibes - local knowledge is key.

Also, transparency. Building in public keeps me accountable!

## Join Me!

**GitHub:** [link]

Looking for:
- Frontend devs (React Native)
- Backend devs (Node.js)
- Designers
- Data scientists
- Anyone excited about discovery!

I'll be posting updates as we build. Follow along! 🚀
